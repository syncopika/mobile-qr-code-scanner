## TODO:    
- go to link when decoded from QR code?

## acknowledgements:
Thanks to the ZXing team (Sean Owen et al.). The library works pretty well :)     
    
Thanks to Jiankai Sun for having an example project to reference (https://github.com/Jiankai-Sun/Android-Camera2-API-Example) and Mateusz Dziubek for an excellent tutorial (https://medium.com/android-news/the-least-you-can-do-with-camera2-api-2971c8c81b8b). I used their resources the most throughout this project but many thanks also to all the people involved in the links I've included in `qr-code-scanner-prj.txt`!
